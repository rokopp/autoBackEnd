    // In your words (do not use wiki definitions)
    // What is compilation?
    // Answer: Humans usually write code like in Java, Html and so on. Machines run on 1's and 0's
    // In order machine to understand human wrote code we need compiler, like a bridge between two of them.
    // Compilation then happens using compiler which executes human wrote code to the machine.

    //todo p2
    // Name 2 benefits of compilation?
    // 1 Easier to write code and no hustle to compile it to machine code.
    // 2 Code is much readable compare to 1's and 0's

    //todo p3
    // Name 1 disadvantage of compilation?
    // 1 Sometimes code doesn't compile. Usually there are rules for writing code and compiler follows them
    // Which can be frustrating for user who can't figure why program won't compile.
