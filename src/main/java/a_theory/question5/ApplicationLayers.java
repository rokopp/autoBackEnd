    //todo p3
    // We use objects to transport data between different layers.
    // What is the difference between Entity and Dto? What is same between them?
    // Answer: Entities should encapsulate their state, which is why they say getter/setters are evil,
    // since they break encapsulation. DTOs allow Entities to export data based on their internal state.
    // DTOs are pure data structures, just getters/setters, and encapsulate nothing.
